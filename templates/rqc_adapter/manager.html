        <h1>Review Quality Collector (RQC)</h1>
    </div>
    <p>Review Quality Collector (RQC) is an initiative for improving the quality of scientific peer review. Its core is a mechanism that supplies a reviewer with a receipt for their work for each journal year. The receipt certifies the quality of the reviewing work based on a journal-specific review quality definition. This turns reviewing into a source of reputation and so improves reviewer motivation and hence review quality.<br> See <a href="https://reviewqualitycollector.org/">reviewqualitycollector.org</a> for details.</p>
